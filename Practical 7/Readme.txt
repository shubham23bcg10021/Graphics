This project demonstrates how to create a realistic water body using n particles in Blender. Instead of modeling water as a single mesh, the simulation treats water as a collection of particles that interact dynamically. This method is often used in physics-based animation, visual effects, and game prototyping to achieve fluid-like behavior.

Features:

Particle System Setup: Configure Blender’s particle system to represent water droplets.

Physics Simulation: Apply forces like gravity, collision, and turbulence to mimic fluid motion.

Domain Control: Contain particles within a defined environment (pool, riverbed, container).

Material & Shading: Use shaders to give particles a water-like appearance (refraction, transparency, gloss).

Scalability: Adjust particle count (n) for balancing realism and performance.

Animation Ready: Render flowing, splashing, or calm water effects.

Use Cases:

Visual effects for animations or short films.

Simulating rivers, oceans, rain, or fountains.

Educational demonstrations of particle-based fluid dynamics.

Requirements:

Blender (2.8+ recommended)

Basic knowledge of particle systems and materials

(Optional) Add-ons like MantaFlow for advanced fluid simulations

How It Works:

Setup the particle emitter – create an object (plane or mesh) that generates n particles.

Configure particle physics – enable gravity, collisions, and dampening.

Apply materials – use transparent and glossy shaders to replicate water.

Animate & bake simulation – let Blender compute the motion.

Render – adjust lighting and camera for the final output.
